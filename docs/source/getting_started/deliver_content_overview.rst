How to deliver new content to a Securebook
##########################################

Layer 0 – Annual updates:
=========================

World Possible pre-installs your content and offers annual update. OYA maintains a 
shared folder for staff to submit content (Google Drive, DropBox, or Shared Drive) 
and annually provides that content to World Possible. All computers must be 
collected and “re-imaged” to get new content. All existing work on computers is 
lost.

Layer 1 – USB Drive: 
====================

On-site staff or teachers add content to a USB stick. USB stick is plugged into black 
docking station. Laptop is plugged into black docking station. Content is manually 
transferred by teacher one-by-one from USB to laptop or vice versa

Layer 2 – RACHEL local area network:
====================================

RACHEL server is installed in a classroom. Teachers wirelessly connect to RACHEL 
from their laptop and add content to RACHEL. Teacher must be within 50 feet of 
RACHEL to connect to it.
Students can dock on red or black docking station and also connect to that same 
RACHEL (and only RACHEL). Once connected, students can download new content 
on their own.

Layer 3 – statewide network:
============================

Add RACHEL to a statewide network. Engage your IT network support team to add 
RACHEL to a dedicated “student” “resident” or “offender” network. Network support
can decide where to install access points to the network – perhaps just in 
classrooms, or also in living units. Teachers can remotely access RACHEL from their 
homes or offices and add content if a VPN is configured by IT network support.
Students can dock on red or black docking station and connect to dedicated student
network (and student network). Once connected, students can download new 
content on their own.

Layer 4 – whitelisted internet:
===============================

Engage your IT network support team to create a dedicated “student” “resident” or 
“offender” network with an internet whitelist. IT network support “whitelists” certain
websites, such a special FTP account that students can access online to download 
new content. 
Students can dock on red or black docking station and connect to the Internet with 
some limitations. Once connected, students can download new content on their 
own. This layer is extremely high risk and difficult to maintain
